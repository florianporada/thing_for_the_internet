# thing_for_the_internet

Thing for the internet is a side project of mine.

It is basically a little thermal printer which is connected to the internet via a raspberry pi zero w.
It consists of three parts

- the printer (node.js)
- the server (node.js)
- the app (ionic)

With this application you are able to send text or images to your own little printer over the internet.

Feel free to contribute or improve or something.

//TODO:
- add passcode support to client
  - ask in client for passcode fromprinter (save in localStorage)
  - if passcode is wrong send error message to client
- add markup support to pyhton script
